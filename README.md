# Sample Application using stonehenge & Chromely libraries

## Chromely
Chromely adresses the problem of creating platform independent user interfaces. 

It is a .NET/.NET Core HTML5 Chromium desktop framework. It is focused on building apps based on embedded Chromium (CEF) without WinForms or WPF.

For more information see: https://github.com/chromelyapps/Chromely

## stonehenge
stonehenge addresses the problem of creating HTML5 based applications without the need to write JavaScript code.

It handles as a MVVM framework and all code can be written in C#. The complexity using a JavaScript client framework is abstracted, the still necessary code is generated automatically.

For more information see: https://github.com/FrankPfattheicher/stonehenge3


## This Sample
The goal is bringing together both frameworks to be able to write cross platform applications only using C# and HTML5/CSS, no JavaScript required.

It is also a playground to improve the user experience for application writers using the libraries. There is still a lot of missing documentation.

**Notes**
* This code is work in progress!
* I will focus on .NET Core to be platform independent
* Still not everything working as expected
* There will be breaking changes all the time
* Is is provided as a starting point to learn using the libraries
* Please feel free to add comments, issues and improvements

All questions are welcome !
